So, the more a feature is used and the more accuracy gained from each split, the higher it's feature importance score. "

    "This notebook focuses on the build and evaluation of two advanced machine learning models that were developed to predict internet access among low-income households.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model achieved a high accuracy of 99%, and had high precision and recall scores of 99% when predicting households without internet access. The model had a perfect precision and recall when predicting households with internet access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model performed well, with only 3 false negatives and 1 false positive in the confusion matrix. This means that out of the 35 households predicted as not having internet access, 3 were actually households that had internet access, and out of the 292 households predicted as having internet access, 1 did not have internet access. The XGBoost model also identified the important features for predicting internet access among low-income households."
